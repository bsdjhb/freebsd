.Sh NAME
.Nm crypto
.Nd API for cryptographic services in the kernel
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In opencrypto/cryptodev.h
.Ft int
.Fn crypto_find_driver "const char *match"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a framework for drivers of cryptographic hardware to register with
the kernel so
.Dq consumers
(other kernel subsystems, and
users through the
.Pa /dev/crypto
device) are able to make use of it.
Drivers register with the framework the algorithms they support,
and provide entry points (functions) the framework may call to
establish, use, and tear down sessions.
Sessions are used to cache cryptographic information in a particular driver
(or associated hardware), so initialization is not needed with every request.
Consumers of cryptographic services pass a set of
descriptors that instruct the framework (and the drivers registered
with it) of the operations that should be applied on the data (more
than one cryptographic operation can be requested).
.Pp
Keying operations are supported as well.
Unlike the symmetric operators described above,
these sessionless commands perform mathematical operations using
input and output parameters.
.Pp
Since the consumers may not be associated with a process, drivers may
not
.Xr sleep 9 .
The same holds for the framework.
Thus, a callback mechanism is used
to notify a consumer that a request has been completed (the
callback is specified by the consumer on a per-request basis).
The callback is invoked by the framework whether the request was
successfully completed or not.
An error indication is provided in the latter case.
A specific error code,
.Er EAGAIN ,
is used to indicate that a session handle has changed and that the
request may be re-submitted immediately with the new session.
Errors are only returned to the invoking function if not
enough information to call the callback is available (meaning, there
was a fatal error in verifying the arguments).
For session initialization and teardown no callback mechanism is used.
.Pp
The
.Fn crypto_find_driver
returns the driver id of the device whose name matches
.Fa match .
.Fa match
can either be the exact name of a device including the unit
or the driver name without a unit.
In the latter case,
the id of the first device with the matching driver name is returned.
If no matching device is found,
the value -1 is returned.

.Sh HISTORY
The cryptographic framework first appeared in
.Ox 2.7
and was written by
.An Angelos D. Keromytis Aq Mt angelos@openbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
The framework also needs a mechanism for determining which driver is
best for a specific set of algorithms associated with a session.
Some type of benchmarking is in order here.
