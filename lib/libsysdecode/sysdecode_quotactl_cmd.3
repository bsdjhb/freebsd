.Sh NAME
.Nm sysdecode_quotactl_cmd
.Nd output name of quotactl command
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libsysdecode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In stdbool.h
.In sysdecode.h
.Ft bool
.Fn sysdecode_quotactl_cmd "FILE *fp" "int cmd"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sysdecode_quotactl_cmd
function outputs a text description of the
.Fa cmd
argument to
.Xr quotactl 2
to the stream
.Fa fp .
The description is formatted as an invocation of the
.Dv QCMD
macro defined in the
.In ufs/ufs/quota.h
header.
.Pp
The function first computes the primary and secondary values used by
.Dv QCMD
to construct
.Fa cmd .
If neither the primary or secondary command values represent known constants,
.Fn sysdecode_quotactl_cmd
does not generate any output and returns
.Dv false .
If either of the command values represent known constants,
.Fn sysdecode_quotactl_cmd
outputs text depicting an invocation of
.Dv QCMD
with the associated constants for the primary and secondary command values
and returns
.Dv true .
If only one of the primary or secondary command values is known,
then the value of the unknown command is output as a hexadecimal argument to
.Dv QCMD .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm sysdecode_quotactl_cmd
function returns
.Dv true
if it outputs a description of
.Fa cmd
and
.Dv false
if it does not.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The statement
.Pp
.Dl sysdecode_quotatcl_cmd(stdout, QCMD(Q_GETQUOTA, USRQUOTA);
.Pp
outputs the text
.Dq QCMD(Q_GETQUOTA, USRQUOTA)
to standard output.
