The goal of this branch is to simplify the data structures used to describe
session and crypto op parameters.

- replace linked/list of cryptoini for session init with a structure
  - explicit IV length?
- replace linked/list of cryptodesc with members in struct cryptop
  - maybe require data to always be laid out as
    AAD || IV (if not sideband) || DATA || TAG/MAC
  - generate IV if needed in common code, not drivers
- add flag for hash verify rather than hash compute
- change copyto/copyback to operate on the crp instead of the fields
- permit separate in/out buffers?
